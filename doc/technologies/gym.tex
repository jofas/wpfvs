\subsection{OpenAI Gym}
\label{s_openai_gym}

"OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for reinforcement learning
research. It includes a growing collection of benchmark
problems that expose a common interface, and a website
where people can share their results and compare the
performance of algorithms."\cite{gym}

OpenAI Gym is an easy to use and easy to integrate toolkit
with a veriety of environments for reinforcement learning
(RL) (cmp. \ref{ss_nn_nndrl}) which we used for training
our agent.

# build gym environment. A full list of available environ-

environment = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')

# the range of actions an agent can perform
action_space = environment.action_space.n

# mandatory first reset
environment.reset()

# generate random action (instead of predicted action from
# the agent)
action = random.randrange(0,action_space)

# observations provided by the gym environment after
# doing the random action in the environment
observation, reward, done, info = environment.step(action)
