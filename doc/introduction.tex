\section{Introduction}

This document records our attempt of building a distributed
application for training a Deep Learing Agent to master a
specific environment.

It should be noted that the focus of this project lies on
"distributed", which means the main goal of this
application is speeding up a task which requires lots of
computing power using technologies and algorithms for
concurrent computing in order to horizontally scale up and
reduce the overall time the task takes for completing
rather than an attempt to find a optimized algorithm that
reduces time complexity of training a Deep Learning Agent.

We will begin with introducing the technologies we used,
starting with a summary of the Python programming language
we have used for building our application, followed by a
brief introduction to Neural Networks. After that we
will outline the frameworks and libraries we added in
order to build our Machine Learning Infrastructure, before
finally presenting the concept of a Message Broker, which
is one crucial part of our application's architecture.

After that we will present the architecture and the
concepts of our application with emphasis on how we
achieve concurrency on different levels. This is followed
by a chapter which outlines our test results. The document
is concluded by giving an overwiew over improvements and
optimizations which can further increase the results of our
application.
