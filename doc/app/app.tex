\section{Application}

% Introduction {{{
Our goal was to make use of a lot of computing power in
order to train our agent to master an OpenAI Gym
Environment (cmp. \ref{s_openai_gym}). In this chapter we
will document how we tried to achieve this goal with our
distributed application.

\subsection{Results}

First, we started developing our application for a Gym
(cmp. \ref{s_openai_gym}) environment called "CardPole-v1".

In this environment the agent learns how to balance a stick
moving a board on wich this stick stands either right or
left.

\subsection{Where to go}

(dynamic data generation, loadbalancing, further optimizations
like thread pool exec in worker (not spawning so often),
destroying the bottleneck in executioner (data parsing))
